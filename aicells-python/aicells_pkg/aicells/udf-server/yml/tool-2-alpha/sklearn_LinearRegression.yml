    LinearRegression
description: Ordinary least squares Linear Regression.
parameters:
  - parameterName: fit_intercept
    default: True
    type: [boolean]
    description: |-
      Whether to calculate the intercept for this model. If set
      to False, no intercept will be used in calculations
      (i.e. data is expected to be centered).
  - parameterName: normalize
    default: False
    type: [boolean]
    longDescription: |-
      This parameter is ignored when ``fit_intercept`` is set to False.
      If True, the regressors X will be normalized before regression by
      subtracting the mean and dividing by the l2-norm.
      If you wish to standardize, please use
      :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` before calling ``fit`` on
      an estimator with ``normalize=False``.

#  - parameterName: copy_X
#    default: True
#    type: [boolean]
#    description: |-
#      If True, X will be copied; else, it may be overwritten.
#  - parameterName: n_jobs
#    default: Null
#    type: [integer, "Null"]
#    longDescription: |-
#      The number of jobs to use for the computation. This will only provide
#      speedup for n_targets > 1 and sufficient large problems.
#      ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
#      ``-1`` means using all processors.
